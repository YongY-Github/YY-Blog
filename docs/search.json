    "text": "Measures of Economics Inequality\nInequality, in economics, usually refers to either income and/or wealth inequality. That is, economic inequality, broadly speaking, is the unequal distribution of income (earnings) or wealth (net worth or savings) between individuals, groups, populations, social classes, or countries.\nFor example, on a global level, income inequality is extreme by any measure, with the richest 1 percent of people in the world receiving as much as the bottom 56 percent in the early 21st century. Within the United States, income inequality is much greater than in most other developed countries. In 2014, the richest 1 percent received 22 percent of total income, and the top 10 percent of U.S. households received about 60 percent of total income.\n\n\nFour criteria for Inequality Measurement\n\nAnonymity principle\nPopulation principle\nRelative income principle\nThe Dalton principle\n\nA quick survey of the literature presents various measures of economic inequality:\n\nRatio measures,compare how much people at one level of the income distribution have compared to people at another. For instance, the 20:20 ratio compares how much richer the top 20% of people are, compared to the bottom 20%.\nThe Palma ratio is the ratio of the income share of the top 10% to that of the bottom 40%.\n\nHowever, the most popular measure of inequality are:\n\nLorenz Curve\nGini Coefficient"

    "text": "Why Prisoners Learn Faster Than College Students\nSource: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oBHzmFFNkW4\nThe YouTube source describe several key psychological and environmental principles that allow for accelerated learning, often observed in prison environments:\nThe Dopamine Detox Effect In prison, the total absence of internet, smartphones, and “cheap dopamine” sources like TikTok or Netflix forces a cognitive shift. While the average professional is interrupted every three minutes—and a study from the University of California shows it takes 23 minutes to fully refocus after just one interruption—prisoners engage in “deep work,” which is sustained, distraction-free concentration. This environment allows the brain to literally rewire its attention span, eventually making dense, complex texts enjoyable to read because the brain’s focus is restored.\nLife or Death Learning Prisoners often study to survive rather than to earn a grade; for instance, many study law to fight their own cases because they lack effective legal counsel. This creates “desirable difficulty,” a psychological state where the high stakes cause the brain to flag information as critical and encode it permanently. A notable example is Malcolm X, who hand-copied the entire dictionary word-for-word because his inability to write a coherent letter was a source of personal shame, driving him to rebuild his intellect from the ground up.\nThe Scarcity Advantage While unlimited resources often lead to the “Google Effect”—where the brain refuses to store information it knows it can search for later—scarcity forces extreme depth of learning. Prisoners may have a maximum of three books, leading them to read each one ten times, analyze sentence structures, and internalize every detail. Because they cannot rely on external storage or “copy-paste” functionality, the knowledge is forced to live in their heads rather than on a device, making the information stick.\nApplying These Principles to Your Learning System The sources suggest applying these high-intensity methods to your own life:\n- The Dopamine Detox Checklist: Systematically remove digital distractions to restore your brain’s ability to focus on “boring” but important material.\n- The Stakes Planner: Artificial or real consequences should be established so your brain views the material as critical for survival or success, rather than optional.\n- The Three Source Rule: Limit your study materials to just three high-quality sources at a time to force deep mastery and repetition instead of surface-level skimming across infinite resources.\n- Internalization over Externalization: Move away from relying solely on AI or digital note-taking; focus on memorizing and internalizing insights to ensure they are truly learned."

    "section": "CORE Econ",
    "text": "CORE Econ\nIn the context of Jupyter Book 2 (MyST), if you are looking to replicate the style of the famous CORE Econ (Curriculum Open-access Resources in Economics) textbooks, you are in luck. CORE was one of the primary inspirations for the development of MyST Markdown and the new CLI.\nWhile there isn’t a single “button” for a CORE template, you can achieve that specific look by configuring the book-theme in your myst.yml.\n\n\n1. The “CORE” Configuration\nThe CORE style is defined by a clean sidebar, specific margin usage (sidenotes), and structured theorem/definition boxes. Add these to your site section:\nsite:\n  template: book-theme\n  options:\n    # CORE often uses a \"fixed\" sidebar and a clean top nav\n    hide_toc_from_sidebar: false\n    # Enable sidenotes for that classic academic margin look\n    sidenotes: true\n    margin_references: true\n\n\n\n2. Emulating CORE Features\nCORE books rely heavily on specific components. Here is how you replicate them in JB2:\n\nA. The “Leibniz” (Calculus/Math blocks)\nCORE uses “Leibniz” popups for mathematical derivations. In JB2, you use the dropdown or proof directives:\n:::{important} Leibniz: The Multiplier Effect\n:dropdown:\nIn this section, we derive the multiplier...\n$$\nk = \\frac{1}{1 - c_1}\n$$\n:::\n\n\nB. Definitions in the Margin\nCORE puts key terms in the margin. In JB2, use the {margin} directive:\n:::{margin}\n**Marginal Rate of Substitution (MRS)**: The trade-off that a person is willing to make between two goods.\n:::\nWhile the consumer moves along the indifference curve...\n\n\n\n\n3. CSS for the “CORE” Look\nTo get the exact fonts and colors (like the specific CORE green/blue), you can add a custom CSS file.\n\nCreate a file named custom.css.\nLink it in your myst.yml:\n\nsite:\n  template: book-theme\n  css: custom.css\nCommon CORE Colors:\n:root {\n  --pst-color-primary: #007d8a; /* CORE-style teal */\n  --pst-color-info: #2d5973;\n}\n\n\n\n4. Project Structure (The “Units” approach)\nCORE books are organized into “Units” rather than chapters. Reflect this in your toc:\nsite:\n  toc:\n    - file: intro.md\n    - title: Unit 1 - The Capitalist Revolution\n      sections:\n        - file: unit_01/01_intro.md\n        - file: unit_01/02_inequality.ipynb\n\n\nIs there a pre-built theme?\nThere is an ongoing effort by the Executuable Books Project and Curvenote (who build MyST) to support these open-curriculum styles natively. Since you are using JB2, keep an eye on the curvenote template as an alternative to book-theme if you want a more “Journal/Scientific” look."
