# Installing JB2 to create a book

For those using **Anaconda + Windows + JB2 (MyST CLI)**, here is the clean setup from scratch.

---

# ✅ Install JB2 (MyST-based Jupyter Book v2) Locally

## 1️⃣ Create a fresh conda environment

Open **Anaconda Prompt**:

```bash
conda create -n jb2-env python=3.11
conda activate jb2-env
```

> You can use 3.10 or 3.11 — both are stable.

---

## 2️⃣ Install MyST (JB2 engine)

```bash
pip install mystmd
```

That’s it.

JB2 is no longer the old `jupyter-book` package.
It runs through the **MyST CLI**.

---

## 3️⃣ Verify installation

```bash
myst --version
```

You should see something like:

```bash
myst 1.x.x
```

---

## 4️⃣ Create a new book

Navigate to your project folder:

```bash
cd C:\GitHub\MyNewBook
myst init
```

This creates:

```bash
myst.yml
```

---

## 5️⃣ Add content

Create markdown files like:

```md
intro.md
chapter1.md
chapter2.md
```

Then edit `myst.yml`:

```yaml
version: 1

project:
  title: My Book

  toc:
    - file: intro.md
    - file: chapter1.md
    - file: chapter2.md

site:
  template: book-theme
```

---

## 6️⃣ View locally (HTML)

```bash
myst start --port 8000
```

Then open:

```bash
http://localhost:8000
```

---

## 7️⃣ Build a PDF

Add to `myst.yml`:

```yaml
exports:
  - format: pdf
```

Then run:

```bash
myst build
```

PDF will appear in:

```bash
_build/exports/
```

> You should have TeX Live installed.

---

# 🔁 If You Ever Need to Reinstall Everything

Just:

```bash
conda remove -n jb2-env --all
conda create -n jb2-env python=3.11
conda activate jb2-env
pip install mystmd
```

That’s the entire JB2 stack.

---

# ⚠️ Important

Do **NOT** install:

```bash
pip install jupyter-book
```

That is **Jupyter Book v1 (old Sphinx-based)**.

You are using:

> **JB2 = MyST CLI**

---

# 🧠 One-line memory trick

> conda → pip install mystmd → myst init → myst start

That’s JB2.

---

## 4️⃣ Create a new book(alternative method)

You need not use

```bash
myst init
```
Just create two files `myst.md` and `intro.md`:

---

# 📁 Folder Structure

```bash
MyBook/
│
├── myst.yml
├── intro.md
├── chapter1.md    (etc.)
└── references.bib   (optional)
```

That’s it. Nothing else needed.

---

# 1️⃣ `myst.yml` (minimal + correct)


```yaml
version: 1

project:
  title: My Book Title
  authors:
    - name: Your Name

  toc:
    - file: intro.md
    - file: chapter1.md

site:
  template: book-theme

exports:
    - format: pdf
```

Copy this exactly, or I use for a little more control:

```yaml
version: 1

project:
  title: My Book Title
  authors:
    - name: Your Name

  toc:
    - file: intro.md
    - file: chapter1.md

site:
  template: book-theme
  options:
    logo_text: "Book Name"   # Removes Myst logo
    outline_maxdepth: 2

exports:
    - format: pdf
      output: _build/exports/my-book.pdf
      articles:
        - intro.md
        - chapter1.md
```

---

# 2️⃣ `intro.md`

```md
# Introduction

This is the start of my MyST Book. 

- [ ] Add more chapters
- [ ] Link my Python Jupyter notebooks

$$
y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x
$$ {#eq-simple}

You can number equations only when needed.

:::{math}
:label: eq-ols
:enumerated: true
\hat{\beta} = (X'X)^{-1}X'y
:::

As seen in [](#eq-simple) and [](#eq-ols) ...

![](figs/TaylorSeries.png){#fig-taylor alt="Taylor Series" width="70%" align="center"}

:::{figure} figs/TaylorSeries.png
:label: fig-taylor
:alt: Taylor Series
:width: 70%
:align: center

This is a caption for the **Taylor Series** expansion.
:::

```

---

# 3️⃣ `chapter1.md`

```md
# Chapter 1

## A Section 

## A Sub-section {.unlisted .unnumbered}

Inline math uses $ ... $.

Display math uses MyST blocks:

:::{math}
:enumerated: false
f(x) =
\begin{cases}
-1, & x < 0, \\
1, & x > 0,
\end{cases}
:::

```

In **Jupyter Book 2 (MyST)**, admonitions (also known as callouts or notice boxes) are incredibly useful for highlighting specific types of information. Because JB2 uses the modern MyST-JS parser, these are highly standardized and accessible.

You can use either the "short-hand" type (e.g., `:::note`) or the "directive" type (e.g., `::{note}`).

### Available Admonitions in JB2

| Type | Recommended Use | Visual Style (Default) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **`note`** | General supplementary information. | Blue / Info icon |
| **`tip`** | Helpful advice or "pro-tips" for the reader. | Green / Lightbulb icon |
| **`info`** | Neutral, informative background details. | Blue / Info icon |
| **`warning`** | Alerts the user to potential issues or mistakes. | Orange / Warning icon |
| **`caution`** | Similar to warning, but often for less critical risks. | Yellow / Exclamation |
| **`error`** | Critical failures or "do not do this" actions. | Red / Stop icon |
| **`danger`** | Serious risks or destructive potential. | Dark Red / Fire or Bold Alert |
| **`important`** | Key takeaways that the reader must not miss. | Purple or Blue / Star icon |
| **`seealso`** | References to other sections or external docs. | Blue / Link icon |
| **`todo`** | Internal reminders or planned future work. | Grey / Checklist icon |

---

### How to use them

The most common way to write these in JB2 is using the **colon fence**. You can even add a custom title by putting it immediately after the type.

**Note:**

```md
:::note
This is a standard note with a default title.
:::
```

**tip:**

```md
:::tip Using LaTeX
You can even put math $E=mc^2$ inside these boxes!
:::
```

**Nested Content:**

```md
::::{important}
You can nest other elements inside if you use four colons for the outer box:
* Point one
* Point two
::::
```

### Pro-Tip: Dropdowns

In JB2, you can turn any of these into a "collapsible" box (dropdown) by adding the `:dropdown:` option:

```md
:::{note} Click to expand me!
:dropdown:
Here is some hidden detail that keeps the page clean.
:::
```

---

# 4️⃣ Local Development Workflow

```bash
conda activate jb2-env
myst start --port 8000
```

Open:

```bash
http://localhost:8000
```

---

# 5️⃣ Build PDF

```bash
myst build
```

Output:

```bash
_build/exports/my-book-title.pdf
```

---

# 6️⃣ Recommended Writing Conventions (Keep This!)

✔ Inline math → `$ ... $`
✔ Display math → `{math}`
✔ Default → `:enumerated: false`
✔ Number only referenced equations
✔ Indent footnotes properly

---

# 7️⃣ Optional (but clean) Enhancements

If you want slightly more polish later:

Add this under `project:` in `myst.yml`:

```yaml
  github: https://github.com/yourusername/mybook
```

And optionally:

```yaml
  keywords: [economics, mathematics]
```

But keep it minimal unless needed.

---

# 🧠 Your Personal “Never Get Lost Again” Checklist

When starting a new book:

```bash
conda create -n jb2-env python=3.11
conda activate jb2-env
pip install mystmd
mkdir MyBook
cd MyBook
myst init
```

Then replace `myst.yml` with your template above.

Done.

## CORE Econ

In the context of **Jupyter Book 2 (MyST)**, if you are looking to replicate the style of the famous **CORE Econ** (Curriculum Open-access Resources in Economics) textbooks, you are in luck. CORE was one of the primary inspirations for the development of MyST Markdown and the new CLI.

While there isn't a single "button" for a CORE template, you can achieve that specific look by configuring the `book-theme` in your `myst.yml`.

---

### 1. The "CORE" Configuration

The CORE style is defined by a clean sidebar, specific margin usage (sidenotes), and structured theorem/definition boxes. Add these to your `site` section:

```yaml
site:
  template: book-theme
  options:
    # CORE often uses a "fixed" sidebar and a clean top nav
    hide_toc_from_sidebar: false
    # Enable sidenotes for that classic academic margin look
    sidenotes: true
    margin_references: true

```

---

### 2. Emulating CORE Features

CORE books rely heavily on specific components. Here is how you replicate them in JB2:

#### A. The "Leibniz" (Calculus/Math blocks)

CORE uses "Leibniz" popups for mathematical derivations. In JB2, you use the `dropdown` or `proof` directives:

```md
:::{important} Leibniz: The Multiplier Effect
:dropdown:
In this section, we derive the multiplier...
$$
k = \frac{1}{1 - c_1}
$$
:::

```

#### B. Definitions in the Margin

CORE puts key terms in the margin. In JB2, use the `{margin}` directive:

```md
:::{margin}
**Marginal Rate of Substitution (MRS)**: The trade-off that a person is willing to make between two goods.
:::
While the consumer moves along the indifference curve...

```

---

### 3. CSS for the "CORE" Look

To get the exact fonts and colors (like the specific CORE green/blue), you can add a custom CSS file.

1. Create a file named `custom.css`.
2. Link it in your `myst.yml`:

```yaml
site:
  template: book-theme
  css: custom.css

```

**Common CORE Colors:**

```css
:root {
  --pst-color-primary: #007d8a; /* CORE-style teal */
  --pst-color-info: #2d5973;
}

```

---

### 4. Project Structure (The "Units" approach)

CORE books are organized into "Units" rather than chapters. Reflect this in your `toc`:

```yaml
site:
  toc:
    - file: intro.md
    - title: Unit 1 - The Capitalist Revolution
      sections:
        - file: unit_01/01_intro.md
        - file: unit_01/02_inequality.ipynb

```

### Is there a pre-built theme?

There is an ongoing effort by the **Executuable Books Project** and **Curvenote** (who build MyST) to support these open-curriculum styles natively. Since you are using JB2, keep an eye on the `curvenote` template as an alternative to `book-theme` if you want a more "Journal/Scientific" look.
